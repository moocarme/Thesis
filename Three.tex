explores fractal architectures for robust signal transmission. Specifically, the chapter investigates the phenomenon that occurs when plane waves diffract through fractal-patterned apertures, the resulting far-field profiles or diffractals also exhibit iterated, self-similar features. This specific family of architectures enable robust signal processing and spatial multiplexing: arbitrary parts of a diffractal contain sufficient information to recreate the entire original sparse signal.
